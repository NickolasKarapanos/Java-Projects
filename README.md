[Abstractions/Interfaces/SuperClasses Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/Abstraction%20Practice) 
 -In this project we explore classes and inheritance. We create a Zoo class that uses the Abstract animal interface and create animals which extend that class. This project prints daily food percentage of each animal and their current weight/name/status.

  -A map-based class for counting word frequencies from an iterator using HashMap of String/Value pairs. Project also includes Junit testing for expected vs actual output.
