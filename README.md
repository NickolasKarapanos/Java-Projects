 A repository for Java Programs
```
[Abstractions/Interfaces/SuperClasse--Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/Abstraction%20Practice) 
 -In this project we explore classes and inheritance. We create a Zoo class that uses the Abstract animal interface and create animals which extend that class. This project prints daily food percentage of each animal and their current weight/name/status. 
```
 [HashMap/Iterators/Junit--Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/WordCounter)
  -A map-based class for counting word frequencies from a book using an iterator implementing a HashMap of String/Value pairs. Project also includes Junit testing for expected vs actual output.
  
[Stacks/Queues/object-oriented design/two-dimensional arrays--Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/Stack-Maze)
 -This is a Stacked based Maze solver which reads from the standard input, the maze data in the form of same-length strings representing rows in the maze.It then attempts to find a way out of the maze from the starting point. Finally, it prints the maze showing our starting point, visited areas and reports back if it found a way out.

[Recursion/Recursive backtracking/parametric thinking--Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/RecursiveMaze)
 -Developed a maze solver using recursive backtracking. The maze solver behaves as our queue based solver only using recursion methods.
 
 [IndefiniteLoops/Array-Based Lists/Junit Testing -- Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/IndefiniteLoops)
  -Designed and implemened a program that reads a list of floating-point numbers from the standard input, representing daily rainfall amounts in millimeters as entered by a user. Ignore negative values, but include zero values. Produces total number of (nonnegative) values read, average rainfall, cumulative rainfall, number of rainy days, number of dry days.  

[Circular-Array/Queues/Threaded Programming/ Junit Testing --Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/CircularArrayQueue)
 -Implemented a generic queue as a circular array and used this implementation in the context of a typical queue-based application.This program sets to serve customers at a fixed rate. Once the customer is served they are removed from queue and the program waits for further input from the user. If the array is full it will report back that it can no longer receive customers or if everyone is served report back that it is waiting for clients.
