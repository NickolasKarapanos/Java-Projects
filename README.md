# Java-Projects
 A repository for Java Programs

[Abstractions/Interfaces/SuperClasses Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/Abstraction%20Practice) 
 -In this project we explore classes and inheritance. We create a Zoo class that uses the Abstract animal interface and create animals which extend that class. This project prints daily food percentage of each animal and their current weight/name/status. 

 [HashMap/Iterators/Junit Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/WordCounter)
  -A map-based class for counting word frequencies from a book using an iterator implementing a HashMap of String/Value pairs. Project also includes Junit testing for expected vs actual output.
  
[Stacks/Queues/object-oriented design/two-dimensional arrays Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/Stack-Maze)
 -This is a Stacked based Maze solver which reads from the standard input, the maze data in the form of same-length strings representing rows in the maze.It then attempts to find a way out of the maze from the starting point. Finally, it prints the maze showing our starting point, visited areas and reports back if it found a way out.

[Recursion/Recursive backtracking/parametric thinking Practice](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/RecursiveMaze)
 -Project developed a maze solver using recursive backtracking. The maze solver behaves as our queue based solver only using recursion methods.
 
 [IndefiniteLoops/Array-Based Lists/Junit Testing](https://github.com/NickolasKarapanos/Java-Projects/tree/main/IndefiniteLoops)
  -Designed and implemened a program that reads a list of floating-point numbers from the standard input, representing daily rainfall amounts in millimeters as entered by a user. Ignore negative values, but include zero values. Produces total number of (nonnegative) values read, average rainfall, cumulative rainfall, number of rainy days, number of dry days.
